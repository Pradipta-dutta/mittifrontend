                            <p>Our mission is to revolutionize agricultural practices with data-driven solutions. <b>The Sustainable Fertilizer Usage Optimizer for Higher Yield</b> addresses soil degradation and reduced productivity caused by improper fertilizer use, which affects both soil health and farmers' incomes.</p> <p>Excessive fertilizer use degrades soil and hampers crop yield, negatively impacting farmersâ€™ financial stability. Our application aims to optimize fertilizer usage by analyzing soil data, crop types, and weather patterns to provide tailored recommendations for effective fertilizer application.</p> <p>Supported by the <b>Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare</b> and in collaboration with the <b>University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad (UASD)</b> and the <b>Indian Council of Agricultural Research</b>, our project is focused on enhancing agricultural productivity while promoting sustainability.</p> <p>Falling under the Software category and aligning with Agriculture, FoodTech, & Rural Development themes, we are dedicated to advancing agriculture through innovation and sustainable practices.</p>
